Hi, I'm Sicheng Feng (冯思程), currently a Ph.D. student at the [xML Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus) @National University of Singapore, under the supervision of [Prof. Xinchao Wang (Presidential Young Professor)](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/). Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in computer science from Nankai University in 2025 and spent my internship time with [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) at the [ENCODE Lab](https://encode-lab-ai.github.io/) @Westlake University.

I am broadly interested in reasoning with LLMs/MLLMs (efficiency, visual reasoning, test-time scaling) and efficient deep learning (model compression). My previous works focus on fine-grained visual reasoning (benchmark & RL), efficient reasoning, and model compression (pruning).


<!-- I have worked with [Prof. Huan Wang](https://huanwang.tech/) at the [ENCODE Lab](https://encode-lab-ai.github.io/), Westlake University, and with [Prof. Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/) at the [xML Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus), National University of Singapore. These experiences have shaped my research interests and allowed me to work closely with leading researchers in the field. -->
